# play-mongo

A template for Play 2.4.2 with Reactivemongo

## Get started

Clone the repository, ensure you have sbt in your path, and code!

## Git workflow

Always create a feature branch for a new feature. Branches are merged back to develop branch through a pull request.
Only reviewers are able to merge pull requests.

Always try to rebase whenever you are updating your feature branch.

## Intellij

You can import the project to Intellij by
 
    File -> Open -> {path to repo} -> build.sbt

TDD in Intellij with Play could be painful. In 14.1.2 version and below, you may want to delegate the build process
 to an external SBT compilation server

To start a compile server
    
    activator ~ test:compile
    
or

    sbt ~ test:compile

In case that the two above ways do not work, try

    ~ test:compile

`~` will signal the compilation server to continously listen to and re-compile updated files.

    
Finally, ensure that you disable the `make` process for your tests

    Run -> Edit Configurations -> Defaults -> ScalaTest -> Before Launch -> remove `make`
